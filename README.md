# Overview of the analysis
An analyst was tasked with determining if investing in a bike company is a good option. Using Tableau, worksheets were generated. Below you will find stories that display these worksheets. While doing analysis, it was determined there are certain peak hours which would mean maintenance during this time may be an inconvenience. There was a gender and age difference seen in bike usage.

# Results:

# Summary: 
Throughout the analysis: a trend was seen -- peak hours and gender difference.  Above are visualizations that present these results.

Two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.
* I would see why there is such a huge gender difference. Is it due to lack of access? I would try to document where the women and men are primarily located and increase access to bikes (if there isn't enough) where women are.
* I would conduct analysis for different times of the year to see if this is still an investment that the company is making. Using prior knowledge, I know June-August months are peak for tourism in NYC. I would try to determine if the bikes are used as much in other times of the year, to see if the users tend to be loyal to the bikes year round.
