# Overview
An analyst was tasked with determining if investing in a bike company is a good option. Using Tableau, worksheets were generated. Below you will find stories that display these worksheets. While doing analysis, it was determined there are certain peak hours which would mean maintenance during this time may be an inconvenience. There was a gender and age difference seen in bike usage.

# Summary
Throughout the analysis: a trend was seen -- differences in hours, age and gender.  Above are visualizations that present these results. I believe women should be targeted by using adds to increase their bike usage. Younger people tend to use bikes, so we can either increase access to bikes in areas such as college towns and "younger" neighborhoods, or provide incentives for older age groups to join the program. There are also peak hours that these bikes are primarily used. This is helpful in knowing when maintenance can be done. Either way, as densely populated NYC is (refer to last two maps above), Citi bike would be a good investment.

Two additional visualizations that I would perform with the given dataset:
* I would see why there is such a huge gender difference. Is it due to lack of access? I would try to document where the women and men are primarily located and increase access to bikes (if there isn't enough) where women are.
* I would conduct analysis for different times of the year to see if this is still an investment that the company is making. Using prior knowledge, I know June-August months are peak for tourism in NYC. I would try to determine if the bikes are used as much in other times of the year, to see if the users tend to be loyal to the bikes year round.
